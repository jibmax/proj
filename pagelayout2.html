    <p>Do not! run away from a bear</p>
    <p>It is a very bad idea to run away from a bear or any predators
    because they run very very fast and they also climb better than you, smell better than you.the best way to protect yourself is to carry a bear spray or a .44magnum
    </p> <br>
    <p>Bears have excellent senses of smell, sight and hearing. They can smell food, cubs, a mate or predators from miles away. Their great eyesight allows them to detect when fruits are ripe.

<h1 style="color:grey;">How to go camping?</h1> <br>
<h1 style="font-size:1.5em">-Plan your trip</h1><br>
<p>-Look for campsites
    at national parks to get closer to nature, National parks offer a variety of campsites within the grounds that have different terrain and natural elements around them. Look for a site that has a little bit of tree cover if possible since you can stay protected from the sun or weather. Find a campsite large enough for the number of people you’re camping with so you can accommodate them</p>    
    <p>-If possible you should find a campground with electricity if you want to stay connected.
Many larger campgrounds have electrical boxes on each site so you can plug in 
and use anything that needs power. Check if the campsites you’re looking at offer 
electricity if you still want to use some electronics, such as portable stoves or 
lights to decorate your site. 
However, campsites that offer electricity are usually more expensive than those without it.</p>
    <p>-Campgrounds usually have bathrooms, supply stores, and fun activities that you can do during your stay. Some sites may even have a water supply so you have access to it for cooking and drinking. Check the website for the campgrounds you’re interested in to see what they offer to help determine where you want to stay.</p>
<p>-Go camping in spring or autumn for milder conditions,
Spring and autumn are usually the beginning and ends of the busiest seasons,
 so the campgrounds will be less crowded. However, there may be more storms and 
temperature changes in the spring and fall months, so be sure to pack clothes for 
different types of weather. 
Find a week or weekend that fits your schedule and reserve a spot at the campground</p>
<p>-Camp in the summer for warmer days, Summer is the peak season for 
camping since the days are warmer and families are able to travel more. 
If you enjoy spending time outdoors in the sun, pick a time in the summer 
to take your camping trip. Be sure to 
make any reservations early since the campgrounds may get crowded and space may run out</p><br>
<h1 style="font-size:1.5em">-Packing the Essentials</h1><br>
<p>-Bring a tent that’s large enough for you and your things, Find a tent that has about 30 square feet (2.8 m2) per person that’s staying in them. Pick a tent that’s lightweight and easy to transport so you don’t have any hassle setting it up later on. Look at an outdoors store for different types of tents to see how you fit in them and purchase the one that best suits your needs.</p>
<p>-Choose a sleeping bag that matches the climate of the area you’re staying, Sleeping bags have different ratings to determine what temperature they can still keep you warm and comfortable. Check the weather at the campgrounds and determine what the lowest temperatures are so you know which sleeping bag to bring along. If you’re camping in the summer, you can use a thin sleeping bag, but you may need something thicker if you’re camping in cooler months</p>    
<p>-Pack food that’s easy to cook over an open fire, Many times, a campfire is your only heat source while you’re camping, so some foods may not cook as easily as others. Look for foods that you can cook on a skewer, such as hot dogs, cubed vegetables, and meats, since they’re the easiest to hold over a fire. Only bring as much food as you need so you don’t take up too much room while you’re packing.</p><br>
<h1 style="font-size:1.5em">-Setting up Your Campsite</h1><br>
<p>-Check in with a park ranger or campground office if you need to, Once you arrive at the campground, check in with a park ranger or at the camp offices to confirm your campsite. Let them know you arrived and tell them if you made a reservation before you came. Ask about any special rules or restrictions they have on the grounds so you know what you’re allowed to do. Once they check you in, they will help direct you to your campsite so you can start setting up.</p>
<p>-Place your tent on flat, dry ground, Once you arrive at your campsite, look for a level place that doesn’t have large rocks or tree roots to set up your tent. Make sure there aren’t any broken or dead tree limbs above the area since they could fall on your tent in severe weather. Clear the ground as much as you can from any sticks or small rocks so you don’t feel them while you’re sleeping. When you pitch your tent, make sure it’s stretched out completely so it’s open to its full size</p><br>
<h1 style="font-size:1.5em">-Finding Fun Activities</h1><br>
<p>-Go hiking if you want to explore the area where you’re staying, Check if there are any trails nearby that you can hike along so you can surround yourself with nature. Make sure the trails aren’t too long before you leave, or else you may get too exhausted before you can finish them. When you go out for your hike, put on hiking boots so you can get around easily without hurting yourself. Take snacks and water along with you so you don’t get exhausted or dehydrated while you’re out.</p>
<p>-Swim in nearby lakes to cool down on a hot day. Check if there are any nearby lakes or beaches that you can go to near your campsite, Make sure they’re open to the public for swimming, or else you may not be able to stay there. Bring a small cooler with you with some food and water so you can enjoy a day on the lake and enjoy time away from your campsite.</p>
<p>-Check what activities are available at the campgrounds, Campgrounds may have special activities or amenities that are available to do during the day. Check if they have any rental equipment, such as fishing rods or kayaks, so you can try new experiences and get away from the campsite. You can also look for games or playgrounds if you want to have fun with the entire family while you’re there.</p><br>
